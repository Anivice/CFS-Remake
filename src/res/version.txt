CFS implementation version 0.0.1, standard version 0.0.1

CFS, or Copy-on-write File System, is a tiny filesystem that is meant to
illustrate copy-on-write mechanics serving as a proof-of-concept.
Current implementation is done using C++ and FUSE, though a commandline-only
utility is also provided to manipulate on-disk filesystem without FUSE.

CFS is under GPLv3 due to its use of readline and ncurses.
